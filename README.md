I made windows, doors, and balconies. The balconies are also specially made to be on the top of buildings, similar to the reference below. However, unlike the reference, I have doors on higher floors, which are what balconies are attached to.
Each asset also has a control node to control its size, and a special attribute, which is grids for the window and doors, and pillar density for the balconies.

## Reference Images
These come from buildings in Havana, Cuba

### Breakdown
The buildings have a distinct first floor, repetitive middle floors, and a flat roof with a railing. The first floor has large arches and columns that extend over the sidewalk.
The rest of the floors have evenly placed large windows/doors that lead to individual balconies that are also pillar-like. Finally, the roof is flat with a railing.
Each building also has a very nice, vibrant color.

### Main Assets
Columns for the first floor, large windows for the front leading to balconies, the balconies, small windows for the exposed sides, railing for the roof.
