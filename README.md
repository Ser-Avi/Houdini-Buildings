### Breakdown
The buildings have a distinct first floor, repetitive middle floors, and a flat roof with a railing. The first floor has large arches and columns that extend over the sidewalk.
The rest of the floors have evenly placed large windows/doors that lead to individual balconies that are also pillar-like. Finally, the roof is flat with a railing.
Each building also has a very nice, vibrant color.
